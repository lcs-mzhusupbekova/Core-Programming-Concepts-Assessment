 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**
 
 */
// Answer question 4 below
var apps : Int = 12
print(apps, "full numbers are required")
var hours : Double = 6.5
print(hours, "as parts of an hour are included")
var mostPopularApps : String = "Instagram , Camera"
print(mostPopularApps, "can write a sentence")
var date : String = "Friday, January 26, 2018"
print(date, "can write a sentence")
